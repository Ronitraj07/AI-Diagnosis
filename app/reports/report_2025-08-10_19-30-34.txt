--- AI ANALYSIS ---
The symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and cough are non-specific and could indicate a wide range of conditions.  It's impossible to provide a diagnosis without a proper medical examination.  However, some possible diagnoses include:

**Possible Diagnoses (ranging in severity):**

* **Gastroenteritis (Stomach flu):**  This is a common viral infection causing fever, abdominal pain, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea.  Cough might be present if the virus also affects the respiratory system.
* **Pneumonia:**  A lung infection that can cause fever, cough (often productive), and potentially chest pain, which could be perceived as abdominal pain.
* **Appendicitis:**  Inflammation of the appendix, characterized by abdominal pain (often localized in the lower right quadrant), fever, and sometimes nausea and vomiting.  A cough is less common but possible due to overall illness.
* **Influenza (Flu):**  A viral respiratory infection causing fever, cough, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain and nausea.
* **Pancreatitis:**  Inflammation of the pancreas, resulting in severe abdominal pain, fever, and nausea.  Cough is less likely.
* **Kidney infection (Pyelonephritis):**  A bacterial infection of the kidneys that can cause fever, abdominal or flank pain, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. Cough is less common.
* **Constipation:** Severe constipation can cause abdominal pain and fever, particularly if it leads to fecal impaction.  Cough is unrelated.


**Recommended Next Steps:**

The appropriate next steps depend on the severity of the symptoms.

* **If symptoms are mild:**  Rest, drink plenty of fluids, and monitor the symptoms closely. If symptoms don't improve or worsen after 24-48 hours, seek medical attention.
* **If symptoms are moderate or severe:**  **Seek immediate medical attention.** This includes:
    * **High fever (above 102°F or 39°C):**  Indicates a serious infection.
    * **Severe abdominal pain:**  Could indicate appendicitis, pancreatitis, or other serious conditions.
    * **Difficulty breathing:**  Suggests pneumonia or other respiratory issues.
    * **Persistent vomiting or diarrhea:**  Leads to dehydration.
    * **Blood in vomit or stool:**  Requires immediate medical evaluation.

**What a Doctor Will Likely Do:**

A doctor will perform a physical examination, assess your medical history, and potentially order some tests, such as:

* **Blood tests:** To check for infection, inflammation, and organ function.
* **Urine tests:** To rule out a kidney infection.
* **Imaging tests (X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound):** To visualize internal organs and identify abnormalities like appendicitis or pneumonia.


**In short:** Don't attempt self-diagnosis.  The combination of fever, abdominal pain, and cough requires professional medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.  The sooner you seek medical attention, particularly if symptoms are severe, the better the outcome.
