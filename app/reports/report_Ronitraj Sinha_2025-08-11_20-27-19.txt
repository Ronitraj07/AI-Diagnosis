--- AI ANALYSIS ---
The symptoms fever, cough, stomach ache, and body pain are non-specific and could indicate a wide range of illnesses.  It's impossible to give a diagnosis without a proper medical examination.  However, some possibilities include:

**Possible Diagnoses (requiring medical evaluation):**

* **Viral Infection (e.g., influenza, common cold, gastroenteritis):** This is the most likely possibility, especially if the symptoms are mild to moderate.  Many viruses can cause a combination of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
* **Bacterial Infection (e.g., pneumonia, bacterial gastroenteritis):**  While less common than viral infections, bacterial infections can also cause these symptoms and can be more serious.
* **Food Poisoning:**  If the stomach ache is prominent and accompanied by diarrhea, food poisoning is a strong possibility.
* **Other infections:**  Less likely but possible causes include things like typhoid fever (though this usually presents with more specific symptoms), or other less common bacterial or viral infections.
* **Influenza (Flu):**  Often presents with fever, cough, body aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms.

**Less Likely but still possible (requiring medical evaluation):**

* **More serious conditions:**  While less likely given the symptom presentation,  it's crucial to rule out more serious conditions such as typhoid fever,  certain types of pneumonia, or other systemic infections.  


**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Monitor Symptoms:** Pay close attention to the severity and progression of your symptoms.  Note any new symptoms that develop.  Are you experiencing difficulty breathing, severe dehydration (due to vomiting or diarrhea), or worsening pain?

2. **Seek Medical Attention:**  While many of these illnesses resolve on their own, it's crucial to see a doctor or other healthcare provider, especially if:
    * **Symptoms are severe:**  High fever (over 103°F or 39.4°C), difficulty breathing, severe dehydration, or intense pain warrant immediate medical attention.
    * **Symptoms worsen:**  If your symptoms are getting worse, not improving after a few days, or new symptoms develop, seek medical attention.
    * **You have underlying health conditions:**  If you have pre-existing conditions like heart disease, lung disease, or a weakened immune system,  it's crucial to seek medical care promptly.
    * **You are immunocompromised:**  People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious complications from infections.
